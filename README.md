Story : When I joined my current organization, I was assigned a Power BI file to work on. On my first day, the backend team informed me that they intended to deprecate a specific view from their database and requested confirmation from all cross-module owners before proceeding with the deprecation.

At that time, I lacked sufficient knowledge to identify the list of views, which posed a significant challenge for me. To address this, I manually checked each table in Power Query to confirm the dependencies, which was a time-consuming and tedious process. This issue has been a persistent concern for me. However, I am pleased to share that today I have successfully resolved it and can now confidently answer my own question.
